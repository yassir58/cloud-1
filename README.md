# Cloud-1

**Automated Deployment of a WordPress Website Using Docker, Ansible, and AWS**

Cloud-1 is a project designed to automate the deployment of a WordPress website using Docker containers orchestrated by Ansible on an AWS infrastructure. The project leverages containerization to ensure consistency, while Ansible playbooks automate provisioning and configuration, streamlining the deployment process.

## Features

- **Automated Deployment:** Deploy a full WordPress stack with minimal manual intervention.
- **Containerization:** Utilizes Docker to package the application and its dependencies.
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible is used to configure and provision AWS resources.
- **Scalability:** Designed to run on AWS infrastructure for high availability and scaling.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensures that every deployment is consistent through automation.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture:
- **Docker:** Containerizes the WordPress application along with a suitable web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) and a database (e.g., MySQL).
- **Ansible:** Automates tasks such as:
  - Provisioning AWS resources (using the `aws_ec2.yml` playbook).
  - Deploying Docker containers with the WordPress site (via the `deploy.yml` playbook).
- **AWS:** Provides the infrastructure for hosting the application, including EC2 instances and associated networking resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Engine & Compose)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (v2.9+ recommended)
- AWS CLI and proper credentials configured
- Make (for running the provided Makefile commands)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yassir58/cloud-1.git
   cd cloud-1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure Docker and Ansible are installed on your system. For AWS, configure your credentials:
   
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Docker Setup:**

   If you are using custom Dockerfiles located in the repository, build the Docker images:
   
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-wordpress ./srcs
   ```

## Usage

The project provides multiple automation scripts and playbooks. Here’s how to get started:

### Deploying with Ansible

- **AWS Provisioning:**  
  Run the AWS playbook to provision EC2 instances and necessary infrastructure:
  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook aws_ec2.yml
  ```

- **Deployment:**  
  Deploy the WordPress website using the provided deployment playbook:
  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook deploy.yml
  ```

### Using Makefile

A Makefile is provided for common tasks. For example, you might have a target to display your current public IP using a command similar to:
  
```make
MY_IP := $(shell curl -s https://ifconfig.me)

deploy:
	@echo "Deploying WordPress website on instance with IP: $(MY_IP)"
	# Insert deployment commands here
```

Run the Makefile target with:

```bash
make deploy
```

```

## Configuration

- **Ansible Variables:**  
  Customize deployment settings by editing the variable files or passing extra variables at runtime.
  
- **Docker Configuration:**  
  Adjust Dockerfiles in the `srcs` directory if you need to modify the WordPress container or supporting services.
  
- **AWS Credentials:**  
  Ensure that your AWS CLI is configured correctly and that the necessary IAM roles and permissions are in place.
